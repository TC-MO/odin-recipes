    <h2>What makes japanese curry different than other?</h2>
    <p>Japanese curry is quite different from most other curries worldwide — it has a thicker consistency, and the taste leans on the sweet and savory side. The unique sweetness comes from onions, carrots, and other additions like honey and grated apples.</p>

    <h2>Ingredient list</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 onions</li>
        <li>2 carrots</li>
        <li>3 potatoes (preferably Yukon gold)</li>
        <li>1 tsp ginger (grated)</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 apple</li>
        <li>2,5kg of boneless,skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to make it, preparing the ingredients!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut onions into wedges.</li>
        <li>Peel carrots and cut them into rolling wedges (it‘s called rangiri in Japanese).</li>
        <li>Peel potatoes and cut them into quarters. Soak them in water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch.</li>
        <li>Grate the ginger and measure 1 tsp ginger with the juice. Set aside. Mince 2 cloves garlic and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cut the apple into quarters, remove the core, and peel the skin.</li>
        <li>Grate the apple and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cut off the extra fat from 1½ lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs and discard it. Then, cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How to make it, cooking time!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 1/2 Tbsp neutral oil in a large pot over medium heat and add the onion.</li>
        <li>Sauté the onions, stirring occasionally, until they become translucent and tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and grated ginger and mix well together.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and cook, stirring frequently, until it‘s no longer pink on the outside. If the onions are getting too brown, reduce the heat to medium low temporarily.
        </li>
        <li>Add 4 cups chicken stock/broth. To reduce the sodium, you can substitute with water only or use half stock and half water, if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Add the grated apple.</li>
        <li>Add the carrots and potatoes. The broth should barely cover the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Simmer, covered, on medium-low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Once boiling, use a fine-mesh strainer to skim the scum and foam from the surface of the broth.</li>
        <li>Continue to cook covered until a wooden skewer goes through the carrots and potatoes.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat. From 1 package Japanese curry roux, put 1–2 cubes in a ladleful of cooking liquid. Slowly let it dissolve with a spoon or chopsticks and stir into the pot to incorporate. Repeat with the rest of the blocks, 2 cubes at a time.</li>
        <li>Simmer, uncovered, on medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the curry becomes thick, about 5–10 minutes. If your curry is too thick, you can add water to thin the sauce. When you stir, make sure that no roux or food is stuck to the bottom of the pot; otherwise, it may burn.</li>
    </ol>
