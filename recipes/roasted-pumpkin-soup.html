    <h2>Ingredient list</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>One 2kg sugar pie pumpkin</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 large or 6 medium garlic cloves, pressed or minced</li>
        <li>0.5 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>0.5 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>0.5 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon cloves</li>
        <li>Tiny dash of cayenne pepper (optional, if you like spice)</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 cups vegetable broth</li>
        <li>0.5 cup full fat coconut milk or heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons maple syrup or honey</li>
    
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How to make it, preparing the ingredients!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees Celsius and line a baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup. Carefully halve the pumpkin and scoop out the seeds</li>
        <li>Slice each pumpkin halve in half to make quarters. Brush or rub 1 tablespoon olive oil over the flesh of the pumpkin and place the quarters, cut sides down, onto the baking sheet. Roast for 35 minutes or longer, until the orange flesh is easily pierced through with a fork. Set it aside to cool for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add onion, garlic and salt to the skillet. Stir to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is translucent, about 8 to 10 minutes. In the meantime, peel the pumpkin skin off the pumpkins and discard the skin.</li>
        <li></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How to make it, cooking time!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the pumpkin flesh, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, cayenne pepper (if using), and a few twists of freshly ground black pepper. Use your stirring spoon to break up the pumpkin a bit. Pour in the broth. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 15 minutes, to give the flavors time to meld.</li>
        <li>Once the pumpkin mixture is done cooking, stir in the coconut milk and maple syrup. Remove the soup from heat and let it cool slightly. You can use an immersion blender to blend this soup in the pot.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust if necessary.</li>
    </ol>
